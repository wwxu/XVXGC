Images for each source are included in folder ``[image]".

Images of source ``[es_1]" is explained below, as an example. 
- [es_1_hist_zsp.pdf, es_1_hist_zph.pdf, es_1_hist_zf.pdf] are the redshift histograms for redshifts of galaxies, corresponding to Fig.4 in the paper. 
** Note ** , for [es_1_hist_zsp.pdf, es_1_hist_zph.pdf], only first panel therein is shown in the paper, while the following four panels in each file are the zoom-in histogram for the four highest peaks in first panel. 
- [es_1_rimg_zsp.pdf, es_1_rimg_zph.pdf, es_1_rimg_zf.pdf] show the spatial distribution of galaxies surrounding, corresponding to the three panels Fig.5 in the paper.   
- [es_1_rgb.pdf, es_1_ximg.pdf] are the RGB and filtered X-ray image, corresponding to the two panels Fig.6 in the paper.
- [es_1_gca_reg.pdf, es_1_gca.pdf] are the region selection and growth curve, corresponding to panels Fig.7 in the paper.
