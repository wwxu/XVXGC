This is the repository for the XMM-SERVS X-ray eXtended Galaxy Cluster (XVXGC) catalog. 
- The corresponding paper is [arxiv:2406.06701](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06701) (to be updated)
- Images for each source are included in folder ``[image]".

#### Images of source ``[es_1]" is explained below, as an example.

  * Note. For es_1_hist_zsp.pdf and es_1_hist_zph.pdf, only first panel is shown in the paper. However, five panels are shown in the PDF file, with the last four panels as the redshift histograms for the four highest peaks within the range of z_peak+-0.015.
