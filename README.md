This is the repository for the XMM-SERVS X-ray eXtended Galaxy Cluster (XVXGC) catalog. 
The paper is [arxiv:2406.06701](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06701)
Images for each source are included in folder ``[image]".

Images of source ``[es_1]" is explained below, as an example. 
- [es_1_hist_zsp.pdf, es_1_hist_zph.pdf, es_1_hist_zf.pdf] are the redshift histograms for redshifts of galaxies, corresponding to Fig.4 in the paper.
  * Note. for [es_1_hist_zsp.pdf, es_1_hist_zph.pdf], only first panel therein is shown in the paper, while the following four panels in each file are the zoom-in histogram for the four highest peaks in first panel. 
- [es_1_rimg_zsp.pdf] show the spatial distribution of galaxies surrounding, refering to Fig.5a in the paper.   
- [es_1_rimg_zph.pdf] show the spatial distribution of galaxies surrounding,refering to Fig.5b in the paper.   
- [es_1_rimg_zf.pdf] show the spatial distribution of galaxies surrounding, refering to Fig.5c in the paper.   
- [es_1_rgb.pdf] is the RGB and filtered X-ray image, corresponding to the two panels Fig.6a in the paper.
- [es_1_ximg.pdf] is the filtered X-ray image, corresponding to the two panels Fig.6b in the paper.
- [es_1_gca_reg.pdf] is the region selection for growth curve, corresponding to panels Fig.7a in the paper.
- [es_1_gca.pdf] are the growth curve, corresponding to panels Fig.7b in the paper.
